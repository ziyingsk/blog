With the launch of AI technologies like Sora and Udio, it increasingly appears that AI will replace almost all current jobs in the near future. A key piece of evidence that delays this era is the absence of a special quantum computing-based thinking mechanism in the human brain, which has not been found to date.

Historically, neural networks were originally [the result of collaboration between logician Walter Pitts and biologists Warren McCulloch studying the human brain](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02478259) (unfortunately, Pitts destroyed himself through alcohol abuse due to emotional trauma). 

The human brain can be mathematically modeled and simulated with great precision? Such astonishments were once experienced when we realized that we are not the center of the universe, and when we learned that our ancestors were merely apes. But a deeper understanding of the nature of things will ultimately lead us to grow stronger.

Below is the Chinese translation:

随着Sora和Udio等AI技术的推出，看起来AI将在不久的将来替代几乎所有现有工作。推迟这一时代的一个关键证据是，至今尚未在人脑中发现基于量子计算的特殊思维机制。

从历史上看，神经网络最初是[逻辑学家沃尔特·皮茨和研究人脑的生物学家沃伦·麦卡洛克合作的结果](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02478259)（不幸的是，皮茨因情感遭受重创而选择了酗酒，最终毁掉了自己）。

人脑可以用数学模型进行极其精确地模拟？当我们意识到我们并非宇宙的中心，以及我们的祖先仅是猿猴时，我们也曾经历过类似的惊奇。但对事物本质的更深入理解，终将使我们更加强大。
