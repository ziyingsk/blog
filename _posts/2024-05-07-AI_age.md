With the launch of AI technologies like Sora and Udio, it increasingly appears that AI will replace almost all current jobs in the near future. A key counterpoint that delays this era is the special quantum computing-based thinking mechanism in the human brain, which has yet to emerge.
Historically, neural networks were originally the result of collaboration between logician Pitts and biologists studying the human brain (unfortunately, Pitts destroyed himself through alcohol abuse due to emotional trauma). 
The human brain can be mathematically modeled and simulated with great precision. Such astonishments were once experienced when we realized that we are not the center of the universe, and when we learned that our ancestors were merely apes. But a deeper understanding of the nature of things will ultimately lead us to grow stronger.
