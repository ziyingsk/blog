In the process of our civilization transitioning from an industrial civilization to an intelligent civilization, many people inevitably face a large number of learning tasks to adapt to the new environment. Knowing that I have self-taught many things, my friends often ask me how to quickly learn new knowledge. I would like to share my views here:

Firstly, I divide learning goals into two categories: knowledge-based learning and skill-based learning. Knowledge-based learning, such as understanding what GitHub is and applying it to work. Skill-based learning, such as learning the guitar, requires a lot of practice to achieve proficiency. This article mainly discusses knowledge-based learning. In my opinion, the difficulty of knowledge-based learning lies in the feeling of being in an unfamiliar environment when learning a new field. Usually, there will be teachers or teaching materials to guide us: this is concept A, this is concept B, and how these concepts are related. Through such guidance, we gradually build a familiar knowledge map. As we understand more concepts and their relationships, our familiar map becomes larger. When we look back, the once complex and unfamiliar feeling is replaced by a simple and familiar one. In this process, there are some key elements:

Knowledge Map: An important aspect of learning is building a knowledge map. I personally like to use mind maps. This way, even if I don’t use the knowledge for a long time, I can quickly recall the relevant content when I look back at the map.

Knowledge Guide: Teachers or teaching materials play a crucial role when we are in an unfamiliar environment. We need to choose suitable guides when we are unfamiliar with a field. This can be achieved by spending time online to understand the evaluations of different learning materials. The key is to recognize that spending time selecting learning materials at the beginning of learning is worthwhile.

Knowledge Learner: Whether our learning is efficient, we can partially feel it. If the brain is not working much during learning, or if we often feel overloaded, it is clear that the learning strategy needs to be adjusted. In fact, we know our brain's operating state better than anyone. Remember, our goal is to master knowledge, not to pretend to be learning!

In addition, there are some small tips, such as if we want to understand a ten-minute video where the teacher does not show any PPT, only lectures. In this case, we can hand over the teacher's lecture text (if available) to ChatGPT to get a general idea first. Also, if a concept cannot be understood after several attempts, it may be due to our existing mindset affecting comprehension or ignoring key details.

I hope these suggestions are helpful to you!

在我们的文明从工业文明向智能文明转变的过程中，许多人不可避免地会面临大量的学习任务，以适应新的环境。了解我的朋友知道我自学了很多东西，于是常问我如何快速学习新知识。我想在此分享一下我的看法：

首先，我将学习目标分为两大类：知识型学习和技能型学习。知识型学习，比如理解什么是GitHub并将其应用于工作中。技能型学习，比如学习吉他，这类学习需要通过大量练习来掌握熟练度。本文主要讨论知识型学习。在我看来，知识型学习的难点在于，学习一个我们不了解的领域时，会感到身处一个陌生的环境。通常会有老师或教学材料对我们进行指引：这是概念A，这是概念B，这些概念是如何联系的。通过这样的指导，我们逐渐构建起一张熟悉的知识地图。随着对越来越多概念和关系的了解，我们熟悉的地图会越来越大。当回过头来看时，曾经复杂而陌生的感觉被简单而熟悉的感觉所取代。在这个过程中，有一些关键要素：

1. 知识的地图：学习的一个重要方面是构建知识的地图。我个人喜欢使用思维导图。这样即使长时间不使用这些知识，再回过头来看这张知识地图时，依然可以很快记起相关内容。

2. 知识的指引者：老师或教学材料在我们处于陌生环境时起到关键作用。我们需要在不熟悉一个领域时选择合适的指引者。这可以通过花时间在网上了解不同学习材料的评价来实现。关键是要认识到，在学习初期花时间选择学习材料是值得的。

3. 知识的学习者：我们自己的学习是否高效，我们是能部分感觉出来的。如果学习时脑子经常没怎么运作，或经常感到过载，那么显然需要调整学习策略。事实上，我们比任何人都更清楚自己的大脑运作状态。记住，我们的目标是掌握知识，而不是假装在学习！

此外，还有一些小技巧，比如我们想理解一段十分钟的视频，而视频中的老师不展示任何PPT，只是演讲。这时可以将老师的演讲文字（如果有）交给ChatGPT先了解一个大概内容。另外，如果一个概念反复看了几遍仍不能理解，可能是我们已有的思维定势影响了理解，或者忽略了关键细节。

如果您有不同看法，或有好的观点，，欢迎到[我的博客repo](https://github.com/ziyingsk/blog)留言。

希望这些建议对您有所帮助！
