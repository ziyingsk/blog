title: "Where are the future jobs?"

As AI technology develops, most jobs are now inevitably going to be replaced by AI. So, what will the people whose jobs have been replaced do?

An obvious answer is that our work will revolve around AI: research, deployment, security, and training on how to use AI. However, we should not overlook another key point, which is that all work revolving around AI ultimately aims to make everyone's life happier.

In today's world, most people are confined by the 9-to-5 work system and cannot lead more imaginative lives. With GPT-4's excellent performance in programming, there's now a saying, "everyone is a programmer". Let's imagine, could we reach a point where "everyone is a lawyer", and "everyone is an engineer"? In such a scenario, could our open-source projects involve everyone collaborating to build rockets or deploy bases on Mars? We would no longer worry about individual livelihoods; instead, we would seek out interesting projects and create autonomously out of our dreams and love for humanity. What an exciting era that would be! (And if someone wants to lie in bed all day, they can do so until they feel like doing something interesting.)

Below is the Chinese translation:

随着AI技术的发展，现在的大部分工作都必定会被AI取代，那么，工作被取代的人们会去做什么事情呢？

一个显而易见的答案是，我们的工作将围绕AI展开：针对AI的研发，部署，安全以及培训。但我们不应忽视另外一个重点，围绕AI展开的所有工作，最终是为了让大家过上更加幸福的生活。

当今世界，大部分人被由于朝九晚五的工作制度限制，无法过上更加有想象力的生活。由于GPT-4在编程方面的出色表现，现在已经开始有一个说法“人人都是程序员”。让我们想象一下，我们以后是不是可以做到“人人都是律师”，“人人都是工程师”呢？这样的话，我们的开源项目，是否会变成大家一起来制作火箭？大家一起来部署火星的基地？我们不再为了个人的生计而担忧，我们去寻找有意思的项目，自主地出于自己的梦想和对人类的爱进行创造，这样的时代，多么的激动人心啊！（如果有人愿意在床上躺着，那也可以一直躺到他愿意去做点有意思的事情为止）
